We proposed a set of decision models for selecting patterns and strategies in four areas of quantum software systems design: structural abstraction, communication, integration and optimization, and data processing. These decision models are proposed based on the knowledge collected from analyzing quantum software development discussions in GitHub issues and Stack Exchange posts. These models will help practitioners choose suitable patterns and strategies to address various design challenges in quantum software systems.
